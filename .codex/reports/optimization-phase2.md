# Optimization Phase 2

## Component Refactoring
- Split the massive `GettingStartedSection` into three focused components: `GettingStartedTimeline`, `GettingStartedSteps`, and `GettingStartedCTA`.
- Introduced a `useGettingStarted` hook to manage shared state between the new components.

## Linting and Type Safety
- Ran `eslint --fix` across the project and removed invalid attributes.
- Converted dynamic icons and state handlers to strongly typed implementations.

## Image Optimization
- Replaced `<img>` tags with Next.js `Image` to leverage builtâ€‘in performance optimizations.
